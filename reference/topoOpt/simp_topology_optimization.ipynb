    "# Topology optimization using the SIMP method\n",
    "\n",
    "This numerical tour investigates the optimal design of an elastic structure through a topology optimization approach. It consists in finding the optimal distribution of a material in a computational domain which minimizes the compliance (or, equivalently, maximizes the stiffness) of the resulting structure under a fixed volume fraction constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the bottom animation, the optimal material density (a continuous field $\\theta(x)\\in[0;1]$) of a cantilever beam evolves with the topoology optimization algorithm iterations. The first 20 iterations correspond to a \"non-penalized\" distribution where intermediate densities (i.e. $0<\\theta(x)<1$) are allowed. However, such a *gray-level* distribution is hard to realize in practice and one would like to obtain a *black-and-white* design of material/void distribution. This is what is achieved in the last iterations where some penalty is applied to intermediate densities, exhibiting finally a truss-like design. Note that the final design is not a global optimum but only a local one. Hence, different designs can well be obtained if changing the initial conditions or the mesh density for instance."

Replacing the shape $\\Omega$ by its characteristic function $\\chi(x)\\in \\{0,1\\}$, the previous problem can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\n",

However, it is convex over each variable $\\theta$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ when fixing the other variable. This makes alternate minimization an attractive method for finding a local optimum. Besides, minimizing directly for a fixed value of $p>1$ does not work well in practice.
